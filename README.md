# Arch Linux - Niri Compositor: Configuration Files
These files together make up the configuration for a Niri compositor. These folders would be places in ~/.config on a standard Arch Linux machine.

_The waybar theme was adapted from https://github.com/soaddevgit/WaybarTheme to work on Niri, be sure to check out that repo!_
